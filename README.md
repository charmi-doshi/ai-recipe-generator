Web App for Recipe Generation  using Generative AI and AWS Cloud

This project involves developing a web application where users can input ingredients, and the application generates unique recipes using a generative AI model. The backend will be hosted on AWS, and the AI model will be trained to generate creative and diverse recipes based on the input ingredients.
The generative AI model at the heart of this project leverages a fine-tuned GPT architecture to craft unique and personalized recipes. By understanding the relationship between ingredients, cooking methods, and flavor profiles, the model can generate innovative recipes that are both coherent and creative. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of thousands of recipes, ensuring it has a broad understanding of global cuisines and can cater to various dietary preferences.

When a user inputs ingredients, the model generates a recipe by predicting the sequence of steps required to create a dish, considering the ingredients provided. The model is capable of producing not only the list of ingredients and instructions but also suggestions for variations and additional tips to enhance the cooking experience.
This integration of generative AI with AWS's robust infrastructure ensures that the application is scalable, reliable, and capable of delivering real-time recipe generation to users across the globe.
This project is a comprehensive demonstration of using AWS cloud services to power a generative AI application. It showcases the potential of AI in enhancing everyday tasks, such as cooking, by providing personalized and innovative recipe suggestions based on user preferences.
